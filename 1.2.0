INFO: pip is looking at multiple versions of ydata-profiling to determine which version is compatible with other requirements. This could take a while.

The conflict is caused by:
    The user requested visions==0.7.4
    ydata-profiling 4.8.3 depends on visions<0.7.7 and >=0.7.5

To fix this you could try to:
1. loosen the range of package versions you've specified
2. remove package versions to allow pip to attempt to solve the dependency conflict
